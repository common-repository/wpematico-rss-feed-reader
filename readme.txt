Add On for WPeMatico plugin. Adds a feature to print pre-formatted feeds contents directly on your pages, posts, widgets, etc. 

== Description ==
The RSS Feed Reader addon further enhances the functionality of WPeMatico by allowing to read and display the RSS feed results using shortcodes, page templates or the get_the_content function on your WordPress site without creating the posts.

= How it works =

The RSS Feed Reader plugin simplifies RSS feed integration and allows you to customise the way feed results are dynamically displayed on your WordPress site with flexible options such as shortcodes, page templates and WordPress’ internal function to change the content with get_the_content filter on each selected Custom Post Type.

In addition many options of the WPeMatico standard campaigns are available to parse and filter the content displayed in the feeds.
 
= Features =

The most important characteristics that makes this add-on the first choice comparing to others are the next ones:

> * Allows to display RSS feed results dynamically, without create new post types on your WordPress site.
> * Set a maximum limit on how many feed items will be shown in the selected post type, regardless of the method you have chosen.
> * Choose a specific post or post-type previously created to display the feed content using the WordPress function get_the_content.
> * Page template for pages only, select a previously created page to display the feed content, you can also choose the default page template from the plugin or theme’s page templates.
> * Generate a [shortcode] using the campaign slug and insert it anywhere on your website (posts, pages, cpt, widgets, and more) to display the feed content.
> * Customize the HTML structure where the feed items will be displayed, adjust the layout, styles and visual components to perfectly fit your site.
